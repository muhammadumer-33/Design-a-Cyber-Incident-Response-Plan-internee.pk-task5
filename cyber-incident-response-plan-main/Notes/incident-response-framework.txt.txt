Incident Response Framework

An Incident Response Framework establishes a formal and systematic methodology for managing cybersecurity incidents. It ensures that every security event is handled in a structured, organized, and repeatable manner. By following a defined framework, organizations can respond quickly, reduce confusion, and minimize the overall impact of an attack.

A standard Incident Response lifecycle typically consists of the following phases:

1. Pre-Incident Readiness (Preparation Phase)

This phase focuses on ensuring the organization is fully prepared before any incident occurs. Preparation includes forming an incident response team, defining clear roles and responsibilities, implementing security tools, drafting policies, and conducting regular staff training. Proper preparation significantly reduces response time during an actual attack.

2. Identification (Threat Detection & Validation)

During this phase, security teams determine whether a suspicious event qualifies as a legitimate security incident. This is achieved through log analysis, monitoring alerts, anomaly detection systems, and reports from employees. Accurate identification is critical to avoid false alarms and ensure appropriate action is taken.

3. Threat Isolation (Containment Phase)

The objective of this stage is to control and limit the damage caused by the incident. Affected systems are isolated from the network, compromised accounts may be disabled, and malicious traffic is blocked. Quick containment prevents attackers from spreading laterally within the organization.

4. Threat Removal & System Cleansing (Eradication Phase)

This stage involves eliminating the root cause of the incident. It includes removing malware, closing exploited vulnerabilities, revoking unauthorized access, and applying necessary patches. The goal is to ensure that no malicious components remain in the environment.

5. Service Restoration (Recovery Phase)

In this phase, normal business operations are restored. Systems and data are recovered using clean backups and verified secure configurations. Continuous monitoring is performed to ensure the threat does not reappear.

6. Post-Incident Review & Improvement (Lessons Learned Phase)

After resolving the incident, a comprehensive review is conducted. The team analyzes what happened, how it was handled, and what improvements are needed. Findings are documented, and security controls are strengthened to reduce the likelihood of similar incidents in the future.

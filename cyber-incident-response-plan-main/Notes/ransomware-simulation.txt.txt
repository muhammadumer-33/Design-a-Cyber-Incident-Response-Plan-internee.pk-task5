 Ransomware Attack

A simulated ransomware intrusion scenario situation was created in a conceptual environment.
This incident began when an employee clicked on a phishing email containing
a malicious attachment. The ransomware ran and started encrypting

files on the infected system and shared network drives.
The infected computer systems comprise an employee workstation and the shared file

resources. Security alerts used a system of antivirus detection,
file modification alerts, and user reports of inaccessible files.
A detailed time line of the attack has been developed. 
This simulation helped in understanding how ransomware incidents are 
detected and prepared for effective actions in response to the incidents.
